# Quadruped Control
In this project, a model-based control and a data-driven control have been implemented to control a quadruped robot.
The performances were compared, and the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches were analyzed.

## MPC controller
Using the MPC controller, the following gaits were implemented:
- Trot
- Bound
- Pace
- Crawl
- Gallop

### Pace gait

## Path planning
Utilizing this controller, an RRT was implemented and tested as a global planner.

## RL controller
All training sessions were carried out using the [RaiSim](https://raisim.com/) platform.
Moreover, training the robot to perform a specific gait was made possible through the use of Reward Machines.

The following gaits were implemented:
- Trot
- Bound
- Pace

### Bound gait

### Pace gait

### Multiple gaits
By using a Python listener, it was possible to run simulations while changing the gait at runtime (by switching the neural network).
