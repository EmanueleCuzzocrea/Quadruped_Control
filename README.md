# Quadruped Control
This technical report presents an analysis regarding the results of model-based and data-driven
control approaches on legged robots. In particular, an **MPC** approach is analyzed in the former
case, while a **Deep Reinforcement Learning** technique based on the **Reward Machines** is developed
in the latter. The robot behavior is tested using different gaits with both the approaches.
Moreover, exploiting the model-based control, an **RRT planning algorithm** is implemented as
a global planner to see how the robot moves in an environment with obstacles.

All the results are obtained in **ROS** using Gazebo and Rviz environments for the model-based
approach and the **RaiSim** platform for the data-driven one. In the first case, the simulation is
performed with the Unitree A1 Robot Dog, while in the second with the Unitree Aliengo Robot
Dog.

### Pace gait

### Multiple gaits
By using a Python listener, it was possible to run simulations while changing the gait at runtime, i.e., by switching the neural network.
